# Setup

The project Makefile builds and runs all components through docker-compose.

Building the images takes time, particularly the Better Auth component used for authentication service database migrations: [`@better-auth/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@better-auth/cli).

First, clone the project:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/openfort-xyz/opensigner.git
```

To build the containers, run:

```shell
make build  # or `make clean build` to remove old images and volumes
```

To run them, use:

```shell
make run
```

The components can be configured through environment variables,
check out the `env.example` and the `docker-compose.yml` files for a list of available variables.

Once you have everything running, head over to the [Getting Started](/introduction/getting-started) guide.
