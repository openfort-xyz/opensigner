# Setup

The project Makefile makes it easy to build and run all the components through docker-compose.

Building the images might take a bit, specially to build the better auth component used to run the authentication
service database migrations: [`@better-auth/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@better-auth/cli).

First let's clone the project:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/openfort-xyz/opensigner.git
```

To build the containers, run:

```shell
make build  # or `make clean build` to remove old images and volumes
```

To run them, use:

```shell
make run
```

The components can be configured through environment variables,
check out the `env.example` and the `docker-compose.yml` files for a list of available variables.
