# Authentication

The authentication service is responsible for verifying users. The auth service,
hot storage, and cold storage all share the `user` concept. A user is a `uuid`,
and the owner of the data it has stored in the storages.

When a user requests data from the storages, it must pass its user ID and access token.
The storages then ask the auth service to verify that the access token belongs to
the user, and only then return the requested data.

The authentication service supports two types of authentication:
- **1st Party Authentication**: This is the authentication service provided by Openfort itself.
- **3rd Party Authentication**: This is the authentication service provided by a third-party provider
such as Google, Apple, or GitHub.

In both cases, the hot and cold storages expect a JWT token to be passed in the `Authorization` header
or in a cookie field specified on the request itself.

## First Party Authentication

In this model, the implementer is fully responsible for user authentication.
The current model is based on email/password authentication, although it may be
expanded to support additional authentication methods, such as passkeys, in the future.

## Third Party Authentication

Third party authentication relies on Oauth 2.0 or OpenID Connect to verify user identities.
Once the user is authenticated, the third party provider returns an access token.
Rather than give this token directly to the users, implementors should map it to a new token
generated by the authentication service (not the third party) and pass this token instead;
to ensure the user has access to the Keys service but can't impersonate the auth service.
